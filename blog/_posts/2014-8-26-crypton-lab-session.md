Our paper was accepted at Hack In The Box! Cam and I will be leading a [Lab Session on Crypton](http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2014kul/sessions/hitb-lab-multi-user-encrypted-communication-with-no-trust-in-the-server/)

**If you are attending, you should prepare the following:**

* A Linux laptop or virtual machine (We mainly use __Ubuntu/Debian__ or CentOS)
* node.js
* Redis
* Postgresql
* git

It is highly reccomended that you [set up Crypton](/docs/getting-started.html) and tinker with it before attending. If you have any questions, we are usually online at irc.oftc.net #crypton
