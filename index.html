    <h3>What is Crypton?</h3>
    <p>
    Crypton is a framework for building cryptographically secure cloud applications.  
    Such applications offer meaningful privacy assurance to end users because 
    the servers running the application cannot read the data 
    created and stored by the application.
    </p>
    <p>
    Using Crypton, developers can for the first time easily build featureful,
    multi user collaborative applications that offer total privacy and security
    "out of the box." 
    Crypton transparently does all the hard parts of cryptography behind the scenes.  
    This allows developers to focus on domain specific challenges.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s3">
    <h3>How does this change the landscape?</h3>
    <p>
    Users will no longer have to chose between the convenience of 
    the cloud applications and protecting their privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Today there are few choices for effectively encrypted cloud storage.  There
    are even fewer choices for feature rich and collaborative encrypted cloud
    apps.  In the future there will be applications like Evernote, Basecamp,
    Freshbooks, and Google Docs and many others with meaningful guarantees
    about your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Crypton allows developers to provide customers a truly private storage
    and collaboration environment with no access to customer data, without
    having to rely on 3rd party security layers or post development hacks.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s4">
    <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
    <p>
    Crypton is the perfect fit for any developer wishing to provide end to end
    security and privacy without the hassle of securing a inherently open
    environment such as the Dropbox API or Amazon S3. With Crypton everything is
    meaningfully encrypted from day one.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s5">
    <h3>Why is it interesting?</h3>
    <p>
    More people are becoming 'privacy aware."  
    Enterprises refuse to adopt solutions where the developer and service 
    provider can access critical internal data.  
    Crypton is the first application framework that provides a foundation 
    for building zero-knowledge cloud products.
    </p>
    <p>
    With Crypton you can develop privacy preserving applications 
    aimed at the already large and growing audience of 'privacy aware' customers 
    without the added burdens of writing cryptography, scaling databases, 
    or matching a cloud API with 3rd party security solutions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s6">
    <h3>Has this been done before?</h3>
    <p>
    To our knowledge there is no existing framework that handles all the 
    encryption, database storage, and private user to user communication 
    needed to build a zero knowledge cloud application.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other cloud applications have been created that involve cryptography, 
    but not in a generalized, reusable form that everyday developers 
    could easily use to build a wide range of new apps.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s7">
    <h3>Should this be happening at all?  Isn't this a bad idea, fraught with peril?  Crypto code is hard and Javascript Crypto is doomed!</h3>
    <p>
    Building Crypto code is indeed 
    <a href="http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2009/7/22/if-youre-typing-the-letters-a-e-s-into-your-code-youre-doing.html">
    famously hard</a>.
    We have some experience with cryptography, and most importantly 
    we have an understanding that it needs auditing and verification by experts, 
    and a development process that lends itself to this review.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's better that the hard crypto code happens here 
    in a centralized and general purpose application framework 
    as an open source project where we can all work together,
    rather than requiring developers to either write their own crypto code, 
    or just avoid building applications 
    with meaningful end user privacy assurance.
    </p>

    <p>
    When building an application with Crypton, the cryptography is entirely 
    encapsulated and hidden.  
    You're just using a simple interface to data storage.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are additional
    <a href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/">
    concerns
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://log.nadim.cc/?p=33">
    arguments
    </a>
    about "Browser based" crypto.  
    </p>

    <p>
    First, we need to be clear that Javascript and "browser based" 
    are not always the same thing.  
    Javascript code might be a HTML5 mobile app running on Android, 
    or a NodeJS based desktop app created with something like 
    <a href="http://appjs.org/">AppJS</a>.   
    Each of these scenarios are ideal environments for deploying Crypton 
    applications and sidestep the objections to the browser environment.
    </p>

    <p>
    For browser based applications there are some mitigations available.
    Chrome includes a native secure random number generator.
    Firefox is 
    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322529">
    working on it
    </a>. 
    We'll do what we can to avoid data exposure through side channels, 
    such as using web workers where possible to avoid leaking timing 
    information into the event loop.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, remember the threat model we're protecting against.  
    Specifically we're protecting the service operators from the dangers 
    of having readable database of end user data.  
    Simultaneously, we're protecting the end user from a service provider 
    amassing a collection of the user's history and data.
    Most of the arguments against browser based crypto 
    don't directly apply to these goals.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s7">
    <h3>What types of applications should be built with Crypton?</h3>
    <p>
    The most appropriate applications are those 
    with significant personal user generated content.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example 
    <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> 
    <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, 
    a collaborative time and project management application, 
    would be a good candidate.  
    Basecamp is an interface for organizing TODOs, tracking your time, 
    collecting documents, assets, timelines, calendars, and general 
    communication among a group of people working on a specific project.  
    All of the "data" that goes into the application is provided by the users.
    The software itself is generic 
    &emdash; it can work with any combination of documents, calendar events, 
    and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Most importantly, the servers' administrator don't profit from seeing this data,
    and even get into trouble 
    <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3078-trust-is-fragile">
    when looking at it</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
    Many applications will have a mix of content 
    created by users and data supplied by the server. 
    They may use Crypton for the sensitive stuff 
    and traditional database storage for public data.
    
    For example, a site like 
    <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>
    might only use Crypton for only a few features, 
    such as the private messaging system 
    where users send messages directly from one account to another, 
    or a user's own list of saved posts and comments.
    </p>

    <p>
    In general, you can think of the most successful applications 
    across many categories, and ask yourself if the market has room 
    for a competitor with meaningful end user privacy assurance.  
    How about Evernote with truly private notes that you could 
    privately share with just the people you chose?  
    RescueTime?  Hipchat?  Skype?  Firebase?  Flickr?  Google Docs?  
    FreshBooks?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s8">
    <h3>What types of applications wouldn't work well with Crypton?</h3>
    <p>
    It wouldn't make much sense to build Netflix or Amazon with Crypton.
    That's true for "multiple choice" apps in general.  
    There's no opportunity for user data to be secret from the server.  
    All the "data" in the system is essentially data created by the server 
    &mdash; the directory of products and movies and shows available, 
    and the browsing history of individual users.  
    
    The server necessarily knows which movies each user watches on Netflix, 
    and which products they buy on Amazon.  
    
    In both cases, the recommendation system is improved by direct 
    calculations made from visible user history.
    The developers directly profit from visibility into this user data.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s9">
    <h3>Why should application developers care about end users' privacy?</h3>
    <p>
    Because having such data can 
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/technology/if-youre-collecting-our-data-you-ought-to-protect-it.html?_r=1&">
    get you into trouble</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because privacy is a feature you can sell.  If you had the choice between using an app where your data was exposed, and an app that guaranteed your privacy, which would you chose?
    </p>
    <p>
    Because withholding privacy allows new competitors 
    to gain a market toehold and become entrenched.
    For example, if a competitor to Evernote emerged tomorrow 
    and offered a subset of functionality but true privacy, 
    some portion of the market would chose that competitor over Evernote.
    </p>
    <p>
    No matter how many additional innovations Evernote added, 
    some portion of the market would continue to chose the private solution.  
    This allows the competitor a guaranteed customer base and revenue stream, 
    allowing it become progressively more competitive over time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Companies offering a freemium product should be especially 
    concerned about this last point.  
    In the above example, end users are likely to chose the free Evernote 
    for their less sensitive and public stuff 
    while paying the competitor to protect their most important notes!

    <h3>Who are the people behind Crypton?</h3>
    <p>
    In 2007 we launched SpiderOak, 
    the first ever online backup and file sync product 
    with meaningful end user privacy assurance through built in encryption.  
    Since then a variety of excellent companies have followed us into this market.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now consumers demand more than just file storage and file sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
    We anticpate the emergence of zero knowledge apps 
    with rich collaboration features that allow data coordination 
    and sharing between organically forming and organizing groups.  
    It's not just about files and folders anymore, but about 
    rich structured user data for a variety of domain specific purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
    We love using and building cloud applications, 
    and we'd prefer not to to wait another 5 years for awareness to increase 
    and meaningful privacy to be a standard feature in cloud apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    We're making this framework available to everyone, 
    building our own next generation of apps on top of it, 
    and looking forward to the rich ecosystem of 
    privacy preserving cloud apps to come.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s12">
    <h3>Is Crypton Horizontally Scalable for a very large, high performance site with hundreds of millions of users?</h3>
    <p>
    Yes, and far easily than a site built with traditional approaches 
    to data storage such as a relational database.
    </p>
    <p>
    The backend data structures are designed for sharding 
    as a site grows beyond the capabilities of a single cluster 
    of database servers.  
    This means the process of building a very large Crypton app server 
    isn't about "scaling it to support 100 million users."  
    It's more like: "scale it to support 1 million users" 
    and then repeat that 100 times.  
    Scaling out rather than up -- a far easier challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
    The nature of client side rather than server side intelligence 
    naturally means that the server never has to perform joins between 
    containers.  
    The server infrastructure gets out of the business of doing 
    calculations on data.  
    Its job is just to reliably store and retrieve data while enforcing 
    quotas, access policies, and protocols.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s13">
    <h3>How do the challenges of developing a Crypton powered app 
    compare to a similar app that did not preserve end user privacy?</h3>
    <p>
    In some ways, this can be generalized to another question better examined
    by computer science: how do the challenges of building an application 
    with a relational database compare to using an object database?
    </p>
    <p>
    We intend that Crypton will enable developers to build against Crypton
    much like a developer would build against any conventional object database.
    Such databases have been in existence since the early 1990's,
    and their operation is documented and understood these days.
    Instead of having to worry about low-level implementation details,
    the developer targets Crypton as they would target another database technology.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="s13">
    <h3>How is Crypton's reference implementation built?</h3>
    <p>TODO</p>
  </div>
  <div class="s13">
    <h3>What code review and auditing has the cryptography in Crypton's specification and implementations received?  How will this continue moving forward?</h3>
    <p>
    Crypto code is isolated into particular designated modules of the
    framework.  SpiderOak senior engineers will do review of all changes to
    those modules before each major and minor release beyond version 0.1.0.
    (We're currently at version 0.0.1, and so no such review has yet happened,
    but see below for the development timeline and other details.)
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, SpiderOak will purchase expert code review 
    from outside security specialists before each major release 
    that involves changes to the crypto code.  
    The crypto portions of the code won't typically change between minor versions.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is sustainable.  Over time, the majority of the framework's 
    code base won't be the crypto code itself, 
    but rather object database features 
    and other higher level functionality built on top of the 
    crypto storage layer.
    </p>
    <p>
    Design spec for all of the crypto functionality needed by Crypton 
    was completed before any development started.  
    We expect feature creep to only very rarely extend the crypto requirements.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="s14">
    <h3>What testing, code quality and development guidelines are in place to
    make the code accessible to reviewers and bug hunters?</h3>
    <p>
    Building software involves bugs, and bugs in crypto code are often fatal.
    Research has shown that a variety of quality control tools are effective 
    at finding different types of bugs, and consequently the combination of 
    several techniques is most likely to lead to reliable software.  
    Among these, human code review is the most important.
    </p>
    <p>
    Crypton is written with human review and testability in mind.  
    This means consistent style, simple single purpose functions, 
    clear code separation, avoiding unnecessary coupling, 
    meaningful function and variable names, 
    and careful code organization.  
    Data structures are designed and specified independently of the code.
    </p>

    <p>
    Additionally, Crypton uses all of the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Static Analysis
      <li>Standard Style Guide with Code Complexity Controls</li>
      <li>Unit Tests</li>
      <li>Integration Tests
      <li>Continuous Integration</li>
      <li>Code Review</li>
      <li>Careful QA Testing by high entropy humans</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="s15">
    <h3>What software license(s) is the Crypton implementation available under?</h3>

    <p>
    A client SDK is available under the LGPL license.  This is suitable for
    including SpiderOak hosted Crypton.IO storage options within another
    application.  This is similar to using the Dropbox API to store data within
    end users' Dropbox accounts.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There are additional options if you want to build a zero knowledge
    application that is entirely self hosted.  In other words, it does not have
    any dependency on users having SpiderOak.com accounts.  Rather, you want to
    operate the server side components of Cryton.io yourself, letting clients
    connect to your own infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
    For this, there are two choices.  If your online service is also free and
    open source software like Crypton itself, then you may freely make use
    of full Cryton code base including all client and server components
    under the terms of the AGPL.  If making your product free and open source
    software is unpalatable, you may instead purchase a commercial license from
    SpiderOak.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many people will say we should make Crypton available under a more liberal
    license than AGPLv3.
    Essentially, these people ask for the freedom to build closed source
    commercial online services with Crypton without contributing their own
    improvements back to the community and without financially supporting the
    cost of ongoing maintenance, development, and security review of Crypton.
    </p>

    <p>
    Such uses are more appropriate under a commercial license.  
    Early adopters may receive complimentary licenses.  
    Contact us.  
    We have a history of making reasonable arrangements for startups.
