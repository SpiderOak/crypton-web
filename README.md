TODO Notes:

Old files are in the 'old' folders.

Once all the styles are in place, I'll compile the less into a proper minified css doc.

After the initial completion of the pages, some tweaks will have to be made.

Various spacing adjustments are neede. Will complete that after all the pages are in place.

TOOD:
- Metawork. Descriptions, keywords, etc.
- Make a prettier favicon
- Build github side-tag
